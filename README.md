Happy Tails Animal Shelter
==========================

First MiniProject for WDI.

===

A simple, text bassed program used to manage the intake and adoption of animals in a pet shelter with a certain number of data attributes for clients of the shelter.  These atributes include age, adopted pets, and number of children.  Pets at the shelter have a gender, species, and set of toys.

This was an exercise in initializing classes, includeing classes in other classes, and practice writing a program while using `require` for other files (the files used to define our classes with their own `intialize` methods).
